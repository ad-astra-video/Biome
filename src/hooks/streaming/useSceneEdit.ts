 *  the delayed `requestPointerLock()` re-acquires lock would be read
 *  as the user opening the pause menu.
 *
 *  - `state` / `dispatch` drive the overlay UI (consumed via
 *    `SessionContext`).
 *  - `isActive` is the immediate "overlay is up" check (used for the
 *    input-enabled gate).
 *  - `graceActive` is the longer "overlay is up OR was up in the last
 *    500 ms" check (fed to the lifecycle machine). */
