/** After an app-layer load failure (model load rejected by the
 *  backend, init RPC errored), the server has cleanly torn down its
 *  in-memory engine state (`_unload_engine_sync` runs in every
 *  exception branch of `WorldEngineManager.load_engine`) and closed
 *  the WebSocket, but the Python process is still alive and ready to
 *  accept a fresh session. We just need to re-establish the WS so the
 *  fix-in-settings retry path has a socket to bootstrap on.
 *
 *  The engine-error overlay persists across this reconnect — the
 *  lifecycle reducer no longer auto-clears `engineError` on LOADING
 *  entry, and `useSessionInit` bails the bootstrap while `engineError`
 *  is set — so the user sees the original error message while the
 *  system quietly re-attaches behind them. They retry either by
 *  dismissing the overlay (returning to MAIN_MENU) or by fixing the
 *  offending setting in-place (clears the error, bootstrap re-fires
 *  against the still-warm WS).
 *
 *  Idempotent within one failure cycle: a `handledRef` guard prevents
 *  the reconnect from firing on every render while `engineError` is
 *  still set. The guard clears once the loading state recovers
 *  (engineError cleared or LOADING exited). */
