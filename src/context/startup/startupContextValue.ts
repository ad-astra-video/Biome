 *   preparing      → anything between launch and ready: unpack-files, deps
 *                    check, install, port-scan, spawn, health-poll. The
 *                    pipeline runs in the background — the menu mounts
 *                    immediately and the user can navigate while we wait.
 *   ready          → server is up and reachable.
 *   not_installed  → engine deps missing; awaiting an explicit install action.
 *   failed         → install crashed or server died; carries the error so UI
 *                    can surface it alongside a recovery action.
 *
 * These four states are exhaustive — there is no "intentionally offline" or
 * "stale" state. In standalone mode the server is always preparing-or-ready-
 * or-broken. Server-mode collapses to `ready` immediately (no local
 * orchestration runs).
