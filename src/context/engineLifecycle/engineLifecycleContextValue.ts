 *                    check, install, port-scan, spawn, health-poll. The
 *                    pipeline runs in the background — the menu mounts
 *                    immediately and the user can navigate while we wait.
 *   ready          → server is up and reachable.
 *   not_installed  → engine deps missing; awaiting an explicit install action.
 *   failed         → install crashed or server died; carries the error so UI
 *                    can surface it alongside a recovery action.
 *
 * These four states are exhaustive — there is no "intentionally offline" or
 * "stale" state. In standalone mode the server is always preparing-or-ready-
 * or-broken. Server-mode collapses to `ready` immediately (no local
 * orchestration runs).

 *   - **Process status** (`status`, `isReady`, `isRunning`, `serverLogPath`,
 *     `check`) — the lower-level Electron-reported view of the server.
 *     `isReady` here means "deps are installed", not "server is up";
 *     `isRunning` means "the Python process is alive". The two layers
 *     don't always agree (e.g. `state.kind === 'ready'` but `status` is
 *     stale until the next `check()`), so consumers should pick the
 *     appropriate one for their question.
 *   - **Lifecycle actions** — `reinstallEngine`, `ensureReady`,
 *     `abortReinstall`. All install / start / restart / abort goes
 *     through here; nothing else in the app spawns a server.
