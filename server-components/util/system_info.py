"""
Server system/runtime introspection.

`SystemMonitor` is the one-stop access point: a snapshot of static hardware
identity queried once at startup (CPU/GPU/driver/etc.), live samplers (VRAM,
GPU util) for frame-header metrics, and an error-snapshot builder used when
constructing `error` push messages.

One instance per process — constructed at startup in `main.py` and threaded
through to consumers (no module globals). The wire-typed `SystemInfo` and
`ErrorSnapshot` Pydantic models live in `protocol.py`; this module produces
and consumes them directly. Anything device-specific routes through
`engine.devices` so the rest of the codebase stays backend-agnostic.
